Project name: App Lock 


I propose for smartphones include a feature in settings that will allow the user to put a lock on certain apps that they don’t want to exceed a certain amount of time on throughout the day. I believe that spending too much time on social media, games or any time consuming unproductive app is slowly starting to take over people’s lives. I see it within myself, my siblings, and friends. Not so much my parents because they didn’t grow up with this advanced technology, but I’m sure many other parents suffer from this issue. I’m aware that any individual can set boundaries for themselves to only spend “x” amount of time on unproductive apps each day, but they don’t always follow through. The design improvement of the lock app will ensure that individuals will start to make better use of their time. My goal is to design this feature within the settings of a smartphone. My intended audience is anyone who owns a smartphone.
